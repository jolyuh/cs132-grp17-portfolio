									<h2>Here's our problem formulation process.</h2>
								</header>

								<div class="long-text">
									<p>
										Anakbayan is a Filipino youth-led organization that aims to mobilize the youth for national democracy
										[<a href="https://anakbayantoronto.com/2020/11/30/history-filipino-youth-activism/">1</a>].
										Founded on November 30, 1998, the group is active in raising their voices about the Philippine government through activism. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In recent years, Anakbayan has been particularly vocal about their views on the two most recent presidents, Rodrigo Duterte
										and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., criticizing issues such as Duterte’s War on Drugs [<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/philippines-duterte-dictatorship-anakbayan/">2</a>],
										Marcos’ Dynasty [<a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/new-york-protests-against-ferdinand-marcos-jr-september-2022/">3</a>], and the Jeepney Modernization
										program launched by Duterte [<a href="https://mb.com.ph/2018/02/11/anakbayan-chides-govt-for-promoting-that-jeepney-phaseout-is-a-progressive-move/">4</a>]. They
										have also expressed criticism towards Duterte’s measures to suppress the people, especially activists, such as the Anti-Terror Act he signed in 2020
										[<a href="https://twitter.com/anakbayan_ph/status/1278997652676308992?t=xRYZVZBEvsA96Y1Efa28lQ&s=19">5</a>] and the extravagant funding of the National
										Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) that was established in 2018
										[<a href="https://uplbperspective.org/2020/09/02/groups-criticize-ntf-elcacs-questionable-2021-budget/">6</a>].
									</p>
									<p>
										In retaliation, Anakbayan, along with other youth- and student-led groups, is vilified (i.e. red-tagged) by these administrations. They are
										often labeled as a terrorist communist group, being marked as a CPP-NPA front by state forces like the NTF-ELCAC
										[<a href="https://twitter.com/upboutcrop/status/1438316119949938688?s=20">7</a>] and antagonized under the
										public eye. Being red-tagged by the state like this is dangerous and leads to harassment and violence
										[<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/17/philippines-end-deadly-red-tagging-activists">8</a>]. Moreover, both President Duterte and
										President Marcos Jr. are known to have a large number of very passionate and loyal supporters. This can be seen in the 2022 Philippine Elections,
										where the UniTeam were leading in the surveys [<a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1171577">9</a>] and ending up winning the elections by a
										large amount [<a href="https://ph.rappler.com/">10</a>]. Hence, we would like to see whether
										the loyal supporters of these administrations are also spreading red-tagging allegations to Anakbayan.

									<h2>We mined the internet for fake news data.</h2>
								</header>
								<p class="long-text">
									Our data collection was conducted in two phases:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Phase 1: Initial data collection using a combination of manual search via Twitter's advanced search feature and scraping data with the assistance of Apify's
											<a href="https://apify.com/quacker/twitter-scraper">Twitter Scraper</a> actor. In this phase, we only collected tweets that contained red-tagging. Both standalone
											tweets and replies were included.

											<ul>
												<li>Number of tweets collected: 150</li>
												<li>Date range of collected tweets: January 2016 to December 2022</li>
												<li>Keywords: Anakbayan, NPA, CPP-NPA, communist, terrorist, komunista, terorista</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											Phase 2: Collection of additional data using the <a href="https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape"><code>snscrape</code> library</a>. We collected tweets
											that mention Anakbayan in general during this phase. Just like the previous phase, standalone tweets and replies were both considered.

											<ul>
												<li>Number of tweets collected: 126</li>
												<li>Date range of collected tweets: January 2020 to December 2022</li>

									The data features that we have notably added was data on their political leaning (whether they supported President Marcos and/or former President Duterte) by browsing their profile history,

								<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>

								<div class="long-text">
									<p>
										To start off, we trimmed off the columns of our data that we wouldn't be needing to perform any analyses. These were the "meta" columns - columns like "ID", "Review", "Group". 
										We only needed them for collaboration in the classroom.
									</p>
									<p>
										Then, we cleaned up the data by going through all the null values. In particular, though, we didn't have to handle <em>all</em> null values because not all values are required
										nor available. For example, a Twitter account is not required to have a Location or an Account bio, which would mean those fields would be null in the dataset and that's normal.
										So in our inital search, only the following columns had null values that needed to be filled: Account name, Content type, Likes, Replies, Quote Tweets, and Explanation for the
										political stance. These values were re-checked and filled in place.
									</p>
									<p>
										We also had to go through all the invalid entries. We had a problem with the Date posted field in particular. With <code>datetime</code> though, we standardized the entire
										column to be datetime objects instead of strings. Additionally, we decided to narrow the scope of our dataset to only tweets from 2020-2022, removing tweets that were posted
										before 2020.
									</p>
									<p>
										Since our dataset had the values for political affiliation (Marcos supporter or Duterte supporter) and presence of red-tagging in the tweet as <code>boolean</code> values,
										we encoded our data to instead read these values as <code>1</code> for <code>True</code> and <code>0</code> for <code>False</code>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lastly, in order to prepare our dataset for the Chi-square test for independence, we created four mutually exclusive columns indicating their political affiliation. We initially
										tagged our data by checking both 'Marcos supporter' and 'Duterte supporter' columns if the user supports both, but since this is incompatible with one of the core assumptions
										of the Chi-square test, it was necessary to create these columns. These columns are also categorically encoded with <code>True</code>:<code>1</code> and <code>False</code>:<code>0</code>.
										These columns are:

										<ol>
											<li><code>supports_marcos_only</code></li>
											<li><code>supports_duterte_only</code></li>
											<li><code>supports_both</code></li>
											<li><code>supports_neither</code></li>
										</ol>

									<h2>Let's talk about our data science methodology.</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="long-text">
									<p>For our statistical, we chose the <strong>chi-square test for independence</strong>. Our hypothesis deals with categorical (i.e. non-numerical) data, thus we needed a non-parametric test to show if there is a relationship between the red-tagging of tweets and the political stance of the tweeter.</p>
									<p>The test requires a few things to be valid [<a href="https://www.jmp.com/en_ph/statistics-knowledge-portal/chi-square-test/chi-square-test-of-independence.html">11</a>], and we'll explain how we fulfill these requirements:</p>

									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>"Data values that are a <strong>simple random sample</strong> from the population of interest" - We did what was possible within our power to randomly sample tweets from 2020 to 2022; in phase 2 we had collected thousands of tweets from that time frame then selected random tweets to reach 252 total tweets. We are however limited by the Twitter search algorithm and Twitter's search API.</li>
											<li>"Two <strong>categorical or nominal</strong> variables." - We are indeed using categorical variables; the only quantitative value is the count of each value. </li>
											<li>"For each combination of the levels of the two variables, we need at least five expected values."</li>

									<h2>Here's what we found out.</h2>
								</header>
								<h3>Data Visualization</h2>

								<div class="long-text">
									<p>
										We wanted to see if our data revealed any patterns, so we utilized the <code>plotly</code> library to create interactive charts. Of the charts we made, we're sharing our most insightful graphs here.
									</p>

									<!-- DATE HEATMAP -->
									<iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~gparagas/16.embed"></iframe>
									<p>
										We plotted the dates posted of our tweets to see if there were any hotspots in dates that we could attribute to certain events. The greatest number of redtagging tweets were found during following quarters: Q2 2020, Q2 2022, and Q1 2022.

										Though the scope is limited to the 252 tweets that were collected by the researchers, which could have been affected by any biases introduced by Twitter's search algorithm, the surge in numbers coincides with three major events:
										
										<ul>
											<li>2nd Quarter of 2020: The first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown</li>
											<li>2nd Quarter of 2022: The 2022 Presidential Elections</li>
											<li>1st Quarter of 2022: Campaign Period for the 2022 Presidential Elections</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<!-- POLITICAL STANCE -->
									<iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~gparagas/1.embed"></iframe>
									<p>
										We found that, of our 252 tweets, the majority of the tweets - <strong>45.6%</strong> - supported neither Marcos nor Duterte. The next most common stance was to support both Marcos and Duterte, which comprised <strong>40.1%</strong> of the tweets. This number combines all types of tweets together, so we decided to group the tweets further depending on the content of the tweet.
									</p>

									<!-- REDTAGGING VS NOT REDTAGGING -->

									<iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~gparagas/5.embed"></iframe>
									<p>
										When divided by whether or not the tweet contained red-tagging, we found that of the 131 red-tagging tweets, <strong>70.23%</strong> of the tweeters were supporters of both Marcos and Duterte. On the other hand, of 121 non-red-tagging tweets, <strong>90.08%</strong> were tweeted by supporters of neither. Notably, the accounts that support neither include official Anakbayan accounts and accounts of Anakbayan members.
									</p>

									<!-- TONE COMPARISON -->

									<iframe width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~gparagas/7.embed"></iframe>
									<p>
										<strong>99.07%</strong> of non-negative tweets were tweeted by supporters of neither. There is only one neutral tweet tweeted by a supporter of both; all the remaining tweets are negative. <strong>69.44%</strong> of negative tweets were tweeted by supporters of both.
									</p>

									<!-- CHI-SQUARE TEST -->

									<img src="./images/chi-square.PNG">
									<p>
										The results above show that we can reject the null hypothesis for those that support Duterte only, those that support both Marcos and Duterte, and those that support neither. This means that both Duterte-only and Marcos-Duterte supporters are highly likely to red-tag Anakbayan, while supporters of neither are highly unlikely to do so. As for those who support Marcos only, we weren't able to obtain a statistically significant result, likely because the dataset contained only 10 samples from Marcos-only supporters.
